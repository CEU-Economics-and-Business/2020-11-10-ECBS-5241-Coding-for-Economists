	Please be informed that the classes are recorded by the Departments of Economics and Business and shared via Moodle where you and all other participants of the course can watch it until the end of this semester. During the recording your image or voice might be recorded. We publish the recording of the lecture with no modifications. After that date, we only retain an edited version of the recording in which no personally identifiable information about you is visible or audible. The original, unedited recordings will be deleted.
