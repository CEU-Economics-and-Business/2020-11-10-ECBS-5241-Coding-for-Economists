## 1. Course Description
### Content
This course teaches how to organize data and code on your computer, and how to write simple programs in Stata to automate tasks.

### Relevance
Quantitative research in economics and other social science requires effective use of computational tools. The tools and methods used in this course will be applied throughout other courses and the students' professional career.

## 2. Learning Outcomes
### Key outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Read and write data in various formats in Stata.
* Explore data in Stata and fix common data quality errors.
* Filter, aggregate, reshape, and combine data for analysis.
* Automate repeating tasks with Stata scripts.
* Run regressions and save their results.
* Create various plots and save them as files.
* Use Stata programming effectively.


### Other outcomes
The course will also help develop skills in the following areas.

Learning Area | Learning Outcome
--|--
Critical thinking | Evaluate and compare different computing tools and methods. 
Quantitative reasoning | Explore and analyze a large number of observations from potentially many different sources. 
Technology skills | Write short programs in Stata. Install and use packages in Stata. Use key programming tools in Stata: macros, loops. 
Interpersonal communication skills | Convey technical concepts verbally. Collaborate with others on technical tasks. 
Management knowledge and skills | Create software with many components. Organize work components effectively. Meet deadlines. 
Cultural sensitivity and diversity | Work together with students of different backgrounds. 
Ethics and social responsibility | Understand ethical and legal constraints of acquiring data. Apply good practices of data protection.

## 4. Teaching Method and Learning Activities
Learning objectives will be achieved through

* This is a participatory, experiential course. Students participate in live coding together with the instructor. This format facilitates quick and frequent feedback and enables students to achieve mastery in their computing skills.


## 5. Assessment
Grading will be based on the total score out of 100, in line with CEU’s standard grading guidelines.

* Class participation (40 percent)
* Take-home coding assignment (60 percent)


## 6. Technical requirements

* Personal laptop computer with administrative privileges to install open source software.
* Stata 16, free teaching licenses available upon request.
* Internet access.
