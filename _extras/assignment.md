## Task
Take 1 or 2 datasets and demonstrate your skills in manipulating and analyzing it. The topic of the project and the correctness of the analysis is not evaluated, only the coding skills you have learned.

Pick a [sample dataset](https://ceu-economics-and-business.github.io/ECBS-5146-Different-Shapes-of-Data/setup.html) ([or here](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/)), or bring your own. You can use a project or term paper for another course to satisfy this assignment.

Feel free to consult class notes, Google, StackOverflow, each other, but **type each line of code you write on your own**. No copy-pasting, please.

> The deadline is 11pm (Vienna time) on Friday, **April 7**. 
> 
> You need to access Stata it via regular CEU ways (computer lab or VPN). If you are not a CEU student and need temporary access to Stata for your assignment, let us know on Slack. 

Show all your work in a public GitHub repository. (Please start a new one.) Submit the link to your repository to complete the assignment. (If your data is too large to add to GitHub or you want to keep it private, please give very specific instructions about how we can get it.)

## Learning Outcomes to Demonstrate
1. Understand folder structure. Perform operations on files in different folders.
2. Automate repeating tasks using Python "for" loops.
3. Use Python "lists" and "dictionaries" appropriately. Demonstrate one of the two.
4. Break up work into smaller components using Stata .do files.
5. Read .csv data in in Stata. 
6. Fix common data quality errors in Stata (for example, string vs number, missing value).
7. Prepare a sample for analysis by filtering observations and variables and creating transformations of variables. Demonstrate all three.
8. Save data in Stata.
9. Run ordinary least squares regression in Stata.
10. Create a graph (of any type) in State.
11. Save graphs as files.
12. Commit files into git version control.
13. Name files, functions and variables appropriately.
14. Write helpful comments and commit messages. Demonstrate both.
15. Push a repository to GitHub.
16. Explain how to reproduce your work with short instructions or a self-documenting master script.

## Grading
### Class Participation
The maximum score for class participation is 40.

Rubric | Score
---|---
Attended 80% of classes, was active in most | 40
Attended 80% of classes, was active in some | 35
Attended 80% of classes, was inactive | 30
Attended 50% of classes | 25
Attended some classes | 20

### Coding Assignment
The maximum score for the coding assignment is 60. The score only depends on the number of learning outcomes demonstrated, not the quality of the analysis question and the project.

Number of outcomes | Score
---|---
n | 3n + 12

### Grading Rubric

The course is Pass/Fail. You need a score of 60 or higher to pass.
