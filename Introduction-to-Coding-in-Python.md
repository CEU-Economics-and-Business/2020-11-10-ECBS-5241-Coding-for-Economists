## 1. Course Description
### Content
This course teaches how to organize data and code on your computer, and how to write simple programs in Python to automate tasks.

### Relevance
Quantitative research in economics and other social science requires effective use of computational tools. The tools and methods used in this course will be applied throughout other courses and the students' professional career.

## 2. Learning Outcomes
### Key outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Understand folder structure. Perform operations in the command line on files in different folders.
* Automate repeating tasks with Python, using for loops and functions.
* Download data from the internet.
* Read and write data in various formats. Explore data and fix common data quality errors.


### Other outcomes
The course will also help develop skills in the following areas.

Learning Area | Learning Outcome
--|--
Critical thinking | Evaluate and compare different computing tools and methods. 
Quantitative reasoning | Explore and analyze a large number of observations from potentially many different sources. 
Technology skills | Write short programs in Python. Install and use packages in Python. Use key programming tools in Python: functions, loops. 
Interpersonal communication skills | Convey technical concepts verbally. Collaborate with others on technical tasks. 
Management knowledge and skills | Create software with many components. Organize work components effectively. Meet deadlines. 
Cultural sensitivity and diversity | Work together with students of different backgrounds. 
Ethics and social responsibility | Understand ethical and legal constraints of acquiring data. Apply good practices of data protection.
